<h2>Welcome</h2>
<b>Welcome to TestUp, the SketchUp Developer Tools test runner. This little
window lets you run unit tests written in Ruby, right inside SketchUp.</b>

<p>See those tabs along the top? Each contains a set of tests you can run
right now. Tests appear as checkboxes. See the example one below?
Click the "GO" button to watch it turn green (meaning the test passed.)

<p>You get the idea. Select one or more tests, push "GO", and see if
the tests pass. If there's a problem, you can click on the name of the
test to get more information.

<P>To add tests of your own, go check out 
&lt;yourpluginsfolder&gt;/sketchup-developer-tools/testup/tests. In that
folder you'll find several sub-folders that match the tabs. Any
.rb file that is added to those folders will be parsed for unit tests.
Read the file in test/tests/bugs/TC_NEW_BUG.rb for a copy-and-paste
example.

<P>Ideally, you'll share your tests as an addition to our github repo, so that
everyone can benefit, and we all can avoid regressions. Visit http://www.github.com/SketchUp/sketchup-developer-tools for details.

<P>
